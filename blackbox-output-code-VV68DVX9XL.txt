If you make changes later, repeat: `git add .`, `git commit -m "Update message"`, `git push`.

# Deployment Steps

1. **Sign up for GitHub**: Go to github.com and create a free account if you don't have one.

2. **Create a Repository**: Click "New repository", name it (e.g., "lead-capture-api"), make it public or private, and click "Create repository".

3. **Upload Code**: Follow the copy-paste commands above in your terminal. If you get errors, install Git first (download from git-scm.com).

4. **Verify**: Check your GitHub repo online – all files should be there.

5. **For Deployment**: Now, in Render or Railway, connect to your GitHub repo instead of uploading files manually. This auto-deploys when you push changes.

6. **Troubleshooting**: If push fails, ensure your GitHub credentials are set up (use GitHub CLI or personal access token).
